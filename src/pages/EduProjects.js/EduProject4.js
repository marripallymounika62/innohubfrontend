          This research initiative focuses on advancing educational practices through Data-Driven Learning Profiling. By deploying AI algorithms and machine learning techniques, the project aims to analyse academic performance, behaviour patterns, and cognitive assessments to construct detailed learning profiles for individual students. An Early Warning System, utilizing anomaly detection algorithms, is being developed to flag potential learning disabilities based on identified patterns and deviations from expected trajectories. The integration of multimodal data fusion, incorporating diverse data sources, enhances the accuracy of learning disability detection. AI-Driven Diagnostic Tools are being created to provide detailed insights into the specific nature of learning disabilities, facilitating targeted interventions. Personalized Intervention Strategies, generated through machine learning, aim to offer adaptive learning materials and teaching strategies tailored to the identified needs of individual students. Continuous Monitoring and Feedback mechanisms, driven by machine learning models, ensure ongoing assessment and dynamic adjustments to intervention strategies. Ethical considerations regarding data privacy, consent, and responsible AI use in educational settings are addressed through robust privacy protocols and transparent communication channels with stakeholders. This holistic approach strives to revolutionize education by providing personalized, timely, and ethical support for students with learning challenges.
